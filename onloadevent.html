			<h1>My Introduction</h1>
			<p><b>Namaskar</b>
<p>	I am Priyanka Jadhav 
	Proudly representing my spiritual, beautiful and freedom motherland India Where the father of constitution Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar gave us the rights to live freely. </p>

    <p>Along with my master’s degree, I am software engineer by profession and working with one of the most India largest world trade Centre Pune.</p>   

    <p>My mom & my younger sister we 3 ladies live happily together, I know what is it to be without a complete family so I always wanted to support my family when I was 18, I started doing job to fulfil financial needs. </p>


    <p>I learn a lot from my circumstances at a young age & I think that’s why I become stronger and more confident women and that’s my strength.</p>

    <p>I feel fortunate to have had an opportunity to work in the pandemic situation and I have always felt that I should be there where such situations exist. </p>

     <p>I love to learn new things, and most about modelling is the sense of freedom, 
     It is known when you love everyone, everyone will love you similarly
	 when you love the camera; camera loves you back…</p>

	 <p>I am that kind of person who loves to have such kind of adventures like tracking, jungle adventure. and taking care of animals especially street dogs, pampering, feeding, and caring them. It makes me happy. </p>

	<p>I believe no matter how few possessions you own or how much money you have, whether you are Rich or Poor, loving wildlife and nature will make you rich beyond measure.</p>

	<b>Thanka You</b>
